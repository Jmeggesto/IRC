# IRC
Figuring out how to make my own IRC things

So, what I plan to do here is to research into and figure out how to get my own IRC client working, or an IRC bot - 
Basically, this is for me to investigate how to IRC works on the level of, actually building something.

I'll have to do research into the way connection works, etc. Probably disassemble some existing IRC clients, etc.
